    <p class = main-title>Hello!</p>
    <p class="intro">&ensp;My name is Raphael J.D.D.S., I'm a high school student currently interested in learning about AI, development (coding, mainly), malware reverse engeneering
    and science and technology in general.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="descriptions">
        <p class="ai">&ensp;With regards to the first topic, AI (a very broad one if you ask me), I'm currently learning how to properly use StableDiffusion
        and Dreambooth to generate art, look at those awesome samples (of not-so-awesome people) right there!
        <br>&ensp; Apart from that area, I have interests in other applications for basic dynamic AIs and neural networks, such as language models (which, in this context, excludes LLMs, although I also have interest in them) and predictions for management and reccomendation.</p>
        <p class="coding">&ensp;Well, I'm trying to acquire a decent experience level in varied areas of coding & programming. 
        I've recently learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript and I'm working to follow the path of system languages (e.g. C, C++ and Rust). 
        One of my most recent coding projects is the very making of this simple website.</p>
        <p class="reverse-engineering">&ensp;More recently, I got interested with the field of malware reverse engineering, mainly since I was initially surprised with the concept of decompling.
        My progress in this area has mainly been focused on learning IDA software and Hex converters (I really liked ImHex).</p>
        <p class="SciTech">&ensp;What is there to say, this is my oldest passion and one of my favorites. In this (very broad) field, I'm currently interested in learning more about semiconductor engineering
        (a herculeous task), physics, chemistry, solar energy semiconductors and computer science in general. <br>&ensp; In some scientific fields, I have earned a few prizes, 
        including the Brazilian Olympics of Astronomy (2 gold medals), the National Sciences Olympics (a silver medal) and the Brazilian Chemistry Olympics (a bronze medal)</p>
